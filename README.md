my favorite thing to do in my free time is probably to play games, like pony town or r*blox, i also like to play the cult of the lamb and deltarune. i also like drawing yes drawing is also one of my favorite things. i like animating too but i havent done it in a while im pretty burnt out from it . im a listener but im also really loud when it comes to my interests, im pretty sensitive ontop of that. i have a typing quirk but i dont use it when im typing things like this

i really like my friends ok they the whole reason i on this website . if you get to know me i'd usually get a bit kinder and i can be more kind if you want me too its not that hard if im being honest!! there is much joy and whimsy in my head almost all the time i am very joyful i love having fun !!! there is so many reasons to live when you realize it because of the amount of things you could do yet you probably havent, if you ever feel sad just remember, theres someone out there who cares about you. thats my motivation to keep going .
